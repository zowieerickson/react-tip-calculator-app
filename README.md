## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Open Graph](https://ogp.me/) - Internet protocol to standardize the use of metadata within a webpage to represent the content of a page
- [React](https://react.dev/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Build tool

### What I learned

- Implementing my first React hook: useState
- The technique of lifting state up for the purpose of sharing state across components
- Using Open Graph to provide rich previews when the website URL is shared on social networks
- The ```inputMode``` attribute that allows a browser to display an appropriate virtual keyboard.
- Deeper understand and importance of accessibility
    â€¢ Some key accessibility features in this project are:
    1. Being able to navigate the app with just a keyboard
    2. Using ```visuallyhidden``` for decorative icons to so screen readers can skip them
    3. Sufficient color contrast 


Before I began this project, I didn't expect to learn so many things. From important React concepts, implementing Open Graph for rich previews on social networks, and making the app more accessible, some personal experience points were definitely gained thanks to this project.
